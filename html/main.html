        <p id="invisible">Welcome to Higher Or lower anime edition! You can choose between the easy,medium and hard game modes. 
            This decision will affect what  kind of questions you get. 
            Choosing easy will cause all questions to be based on anime shows, medium will be about the individual characters in shows and hard will focus on voice actors.

            The general rules apply: If you think the instance on the right has more viewers/ fans than the instance that your given, you press higher.
